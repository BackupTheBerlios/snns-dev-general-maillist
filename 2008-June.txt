Subject: [Snns-dev-general] SNNS license changes to the LGPL
Message-ID: <486104EC.2070109@uni-tuebingen.de>

Hello everyone,

I'm a research assistant at the department of computer architecture in
Tuebingen.  First I want to thank all the developers in the SNNS
development project. You all made important contributions and kept the
project alive.

Today I'm glad to announce that Professor Zell has decided to change
SNNS's license to the LGPL. I have created a new SNNS source package
that includes some bugfixes, the new license and all the patches
provided by the  SNNS development project.  I would be happy to include
the names of the patch authors in the release file, if they want so. If
any of the patch authors has concerns about the inclusion of his/her
patch in the official distribution, please let me know. You can download
the sources here:

http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/SNNS/SNNSv4.3.tar.gz

I'll wait for comments (and/or protest ;)) from this list and then, if
there are no serious issues, update the official website.

We are now trying to get SNNS to run on x86 64-bit architectures. This
is a side project though, and there is no release date for this.

Best regards,
    Hannes Planatscher

I am glad to hear this, I just hope it's not too late yet. I am afraid
there are quite a few people who already put this into the "abandoned
projects" folder.

Please consider this patch:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=155537&action=view
aswell, I did not yet find the time to add it.

Would be nice, thank you.

I think you included python/snns/krui.c.orig in the tarball.

It would be very nice if you could elaborate on why the version 2 from 1991
of the LGPL was picked. I understand that some people do not like version
3 of the LGPL, but I don't see why you did not at least use version 2.1 from 1999.

There are some people who consider this already working, at least with this
patch:
http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/sci-mathematics/snns/files/4.2-fPIC-python.patch?rev=1.1.1.1&view=markup
Please contact Jan Brinkmann <luckyduck_??t_gentoo.org> if there are
problems he wasn't aware of.

Thank you very much,

Patrick

Hmm, its you and? Do you have some names I should include. Or could the
developers, who want to be included, send me a short notice?

Ups. I'll remove this, thanks.

Yeah, we will take the version 2.1. I just used the wrong  link on 
gnu.org ;).

Nice! I've got SNNS compiled on AMD64 :). I do not know however, if
there are some hacks in SNNS that come up afterwards?. We will see.

Thank you for the useful hints!

I'll make the changes in the package and post updates on this list.

All the best,
