I have never tried it, but it seems that at least someone started to
implement such a feature.

There are functions in the kernel interface that are used to assign &quot;class&quot;
information to patterns and to make use of it - setClassInfo,
setClassDistribution and useClassDistribution.

I have no idea how useful it is or how to use it (except from
using the kernel interface). Looks like this is a rather late feature that
didn't yet make it into the user interface - or I am just a little blind
and didn't notice. Any experience reports for this part of the kernel are
highly welcome :-)

Bye, Patrick
