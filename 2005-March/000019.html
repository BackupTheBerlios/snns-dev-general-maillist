<PRE>Hallo Andre,

what you say about the guy is very interesting, since I never thought before to work in batch mode, I have always
preferred the visual way to deal with my data, but now that you say so I think I will consider it.

Coming back to the Xaw3d installation,  I think that didn't work even if I can open snns, in fact when I try to load a
file, from the FILE menu, I'm not able to go through the directories, for the cliking of the mouse only behave like to
go up and down but doesn't allow me to double clik on a specific directory to select it and go inside it to look for my
files.

Nevertheless, I don't know which other way to use for building the libraries, since if I do it by the SGI page, that is
automatically, I'm not allowed to choose the directory where I want the lib to build. This also doesn't matter maybe,
since when I do the building manually in my own directory the installation of snns stop with the same message that is:

ld32: WARNING 85: definition of vendorShellWidgetClass in /usr/people/armida/xc/lib/Xaw3d/libXaw3d.a(Vendor.o) preempts
that definition in /usr/lib32/libXt.so.


and that sound like some sort of conflicts with the libXt.

Anyway, the reason why maybe it doesn't work, apart from the said problem, is that I don't have IMAKE and so I tried the
&quot;building without an X11 source tree&quot;, during the building this is what I got:
