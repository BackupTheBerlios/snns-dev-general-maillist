Please try the attached batch file with the example net/patterns from the
original SNNS distribution. Works fine for me and gives different results
depending on the last parameter.

Subject: [Snns-dev-general] Batchman using "execute" question
Message-ID: <159f6a1563ce.1563ce159f6a@liu.se>

Hi all!

Do anybody know how to use "execute" when running Batchman under WindowsXp? Does it only work for the SNNS "internal" functions as "analyze", "snns2c"? 

Is it only built to accept UNIX commands?

Thanks for the help!

As far as I can tell, the SNNS "internal" functions are also just plain
simple ordinary executables. So it should be possible to call anything else
that's in your %PATH%.

Hi Eduardo,

you have to understand that your return values are inside of variables. Like
in other OS too

try this construct inside your bat-file (e.g. "test.bat") file:

execute("vol",s1, s2, s3, s4, s5,s6,s7,s8)
print (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5,s6,s7,s8)

start this with batchman -f test.bat.

something like:

Datentr?gerinLaufwerkF:istworkDatentr?gernummer:5C77-B2D6

Is the result (just in English)

You need as many variables as you expect string values as return from your
(dos)shell command.

Tell us if you have success or not.

regards

[Andr? El-Ama]

The above trainNet() is not sufficient.
You must run it in a loop to get the desired results.

For example:
setLearnFunc("Dynamic_LVQ",0.0,0.0,10,3)
(0.0 to make sure learning is not successful)

for num := 0 to 50 do
 trainNet()
endfor	

Gives a maximum of 3 hidden units per class.

Message-ID: <42304E3C.179DA87A@ipcf.cnr.it>

Dear Developers,

dear users,


I patched SNNSv4.2 following the instructions in the SNNS-development
homepage, using the snns-4.2-20040227.patch, on my Irix64 6.5. I then
proceeded to configure and install SNNS. I had no problem during
configuration but when I tried to install, I got the following error
message:

hannibal 33% make install
        cd tools/sources && make install-strip
make: file `Makefile' line 31: Must be a separator (: or ::) for rules
(bu39)
make: file `Makefile' line 31: Syntax error
*** Error code 1 (bu21)

This error only appear after patching. Here is the outputs of the
patching operation:

Most likely you are not using GNU make but Irix make?
I am not familiar with the Makefile syntax for Irix, so it would be nice if
you could grab your text editor and try to fix that line. Perhaps it does
not support the "+=" for variables, please try replacing that by a "=".

Hallo Armida,

to avoid another error source. Please just take one of the following
commands for your configuration:

	--quiet           suppress most of the configuration messages
	--enable-global   use global installation path --prefix
	--prefix          path for global installation
	--x-includes      alternative path for X include files
	--x-libraries     alternative path for X libraries
	--no-create       test run, don't change any output files
	
e.g.like

	configure
	-> will install to <SNNSDIR>/[tools|xgui]/bin/<HOST>

	configure --enable-global
	-> will install to /usr/local/bin

	configure --enable-global --prefix /home/yourdir
	-> will install to /home/yourdir/bin


!!! Do not try to install ENZO !!!


It is just compatible with SNNS4.1 and we [snns-dev] don't support it
until now!

regards and good luck!

[Andre El-Ama]

Dear Patrick,

Dear Andre,

thank you for your help. I actually was able to overcome the problem due
to the +=, just deleting the +, as Patrick suggested. The problem now is
that the installation stopped cause it was looking for the Xaw3d
library, which I didn't build because I found it very difficult to do. I
hoped was not absolutely necessary to build the Xaw3d library, but it
seems is not the case, or there is a way to get anyway the patched
installation working? 

The following is the error message that I get:

Hallo Armida,

it is absolutly neccesary to have the Xaw3d installed to use the GUI of
the SNNS. Most LINUX destributions will do that during the normal X11
installation. It seem that IRIX don't.


A link to the latest version:

http://www.visi.com/~hawkeyd/xaw3d.html

and here are an installation intruction especially for IRIX:

http://freeware.sgi.com/Installable/Xaw3d-1.5.html

I think you will have success!

regards

[Andre El-Ama]

I guess the reason is that it is not able to see the new 32 n32, because
it goes to /usr/freeware/lib/ instead of going to /usr/freeware/lib32.
How may I tell him to go there to find the right lib?

Thanks for your help and greetings from Italy,

Hallo Armida,

these are the configure options:

	--quiet           suppress most of the configuration messages
	--enable-global   use global installation path --prefix
	--prefix          path for global installation
	--x-includes      alternative path for X include files
	--x-libraries     alternative path for X libraries
	--no-create       test run, don't change any output files

take this one

	--x-libraries     alternative path for X libraries

and point to your X-libs:

So you have to type in:

configure --x-libraries /usr/freeware/lib32
make install
make compile
make clean


greetings to Italy and success to your work!

[Andre EL-Ama]

You could of course replace the -lXaw3d by -lXaw in the Makefile, but
perhaps you will run into the problems that made us use Xaw3d in the first
place: It seems that the GUI is broken for newer X-Servers - many popup
menus simply don't work when not using Xaw3d. Since Irix uses a different
X server than Linux, you maybe get away with it.

Bye, Patrick

it looks like there are some kind of conflicts between the Xt lib and
the libXaw3d. Any suggestion?

Thanks,

Hallo Armida,

these are the configure options:

	--quiet           suppress most of the configuration messages
	--enable-global   use global installation path --prefix
	--prefix          path for global installation
	--x-includes      alternative path for X include files
	--x-libraries     alternative path for X libraries
	--no-create       test run, don't change any output files

take this one

	--x-libraries     alternative path for X libraries

and point to your X-libs:

So you have to type in:

configure --x-libraries /usr/freeware/lib32
make install
make compile
make clean


greetings to Italy and success to your work!

[Andre EL-Ama]

Dear Andre,

I guess the reason is that it is not able to see the new 32 n32, because
it goes to /usr/freeware/lib/ instead of going to /usr/freeware/lib32.
How may I tell him to go there to find the right lib?

Thanks for your help and greetings from Italy,

Hello Armida,

did the SNNS GUI work?

This seem to just warnings witch are not so serious. (I hope so!)

Please start your X11 and try to start the SNNS from "SNNSv4.2/xgui/bin"
with the "xgui" command from a shell and please report possible error logs.

regards

[Andre El-Ama]

Hello Armida,

I believe the problem is your X11-System search for the libraries in
"/usr/lib32" and similar and your Xaw3D is installed to
"/usr/freeware/lib32"

Sorry but I think you have to reinstall the Xaw3d library for "/usr/lib32"
replace this in the installation instructions (I send as a link) and after
that type:

configure --x-libraries /usr/lib32 --enable-global --prefix
/usr/people/armida/SNNS/SNNSv4.2/xgui/bin/mips-sgi-irix6.5/xgui
make install
make compile
make clean

I believe this works you are only one step away from a working SNNS.

Good luck!

regards

[Andre El-Ama]

when I run the gui....it works. Does it means that everything went well?
Or should I expect problems somewhere?  Because I found no difference in
the graphic, and I still cannot see how to enter commands in the status
line, I cannot even find a status line, as described at pag. 103 of the
manual.

Ciao Armida

Hello Armida,

This seem to be ok.

Commands in the status line:
I have nerver really worked with the Graphical Network Editor.
But as far I can say it works very well on Linux.
I prefer the bignet panel to create my networks - on Page 119 ff,
or better the ff_bignet tool - on page 270

For a real efficient scientific work you have to get fimilar with the
Batchman and the SNNS-tools like ff_bignet (manual p. 235 and p 268). 
The GUI of the SNNS is just like a visualisation plattform for your
results and a place were you can do little adjustments and
optimisations. The SNNS GUI is also good for small examples with a small
amount of patterns and small networks. For real big turns with a lot of
changing setup parameters you need the batchman and the tools. 

Please try an SNNS example like the "letter" example or the to be sure
the SNNS works correctly, before you start with your own work to avoid a
waste of your reserach time. 

Feel free to ask for further support!

regards

[Andre El-Ama]

Hallo Andre,

what you say about the guy is very interesting, since I never thought before to work in batch mode, I have always
preferred the visual way to deal with my data, but now that you say so I think I will consider it.

Coming back to the Xaw3d installation,  I think that didn't work even if I can open snns, in fact when I try to load a
file, from the FILE menu, I'm not able to go through the directories, for the cliking of the mouse only behave like to
go up and down but doesn't allow me to double clik on a specific directory to select it and go inside it to look for my
files.

Nevertheless, I don't know which other way to use for building the libraries, since if I do it by the SGI page, that is
automatically, I'm not allowed to choose the directory where I want the lib to build. This also doesn't matter maybe,
since when I do the building manually in my own directory the installation of snns stop with the same message that is:

ld32: WARNING 85: definition of vendorShellWidgetClass in /usr/people/armida/xc/lib/Xaw3d/libXaw3d.a(Vendor.o) preempts
that definition in /usr/lib32/libXt.so.


and that sound like some sort of conflicts with the libXt.

Anyway, the reason why maybe it doesn't work, apart from the said problem, is that I don't have IMAKE and so I tried the
"building without an X11 source tree", during the building this is what I got:

So I think I will give up with snns for the moment, because now I'm too much demoralized :-{

But thanks for your very kind help!

Ciao and greeting to germany,

I have never tried it, but it seems that at least someone started to
implement such a feature.

There are functions in the kernel interface that are used to assign "class"
information to patterns and to make use of it - setClassInfo,
setClassDistribution and useClassDistribution.

I have no idea how useful it is or how to use it (except from
using the kernel interface). Looks like this is a rather late feature that
didn't yet make it into the user interface - or I am just a little blind
and didn't notice. Any experience reports for this part of the kernel are
highly welcome :-)

Bye, Patrick
