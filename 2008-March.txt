Sorry for answering so late...

There is no "cookbook" I know of for the krui interface, but you can have a
look at the examples for the Python bindings I wrote a few years ago like
"encodertest.py" and "som_cube_winners.py". The Python bindings follow the
C interface very closely (except where it could be made a bit more
comfortable), just watch out for all those "krui.something()" lines which
tell you the functions you have to call and their order.

Hope that helps,

Patrick
