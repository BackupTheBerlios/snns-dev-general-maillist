Subject: [Snns-dev-general] Network topology article
Message-ID: <0B2F845E9599D611A6FA00B0D0D1DE4A0200D289@exch-staff4.ul.ie>

Hi all,
I seem to remember that a while ago, in the past couple of months, someone
posted a
reference to an article on the list relating to choosing network topology
which I meant to source and read.
 
However the mail that contained the articles details got deleted and I can't
seem to find it in the list archives
(although the post might have been to the old list address I'm not 100% on
that one).
 
Apologises for the lack of details regarding the actual article, I just
remember that the post was not that long ago,
but if someone has the details could they send it on to me when they get a
chance?
 
Many thanks
Thomas
